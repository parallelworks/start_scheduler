#                    CONFIGURATION FOR DISTRIBUTED EXECUTOR
#                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

# FILE AND DIRECTORY PATHS...
#         On Windows use either forward slashes or _double_ back slashes as
#         separators within paths. We recommend to apply forward slashes
#         regardless of the operating system

# VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION...
#         Any property value or a part thereof may include a reference to
#         another property or an operating system environment variable
#         using "${property-or-variable-name}" syntax. Mind the capitalization!

# GTIHOME SETTING...
#         The executor automatically sets GTIHOME environment variable for
#         the solver based on the locations from which the distributed process
#         is started. Any externally set value of GTIHOME is ignored. In a rare
#         event when the solver should use a different GTIHOME than distributed,
#         contact support@gtisoft.com for instructions.

# Working directory. Choose a local file system with enough space. This location
# will be used to store job resources and execution node state. This directory
# MUST EXIST when application is started.
GTDistributed.work-dir = /var/opt/gtsuite/gtdistd

# License servers: <port1>@<host1>:<port2>@<host2>. On Windows, the separator is
# a semicolon. By default uses a value from an environment variable.
GTDistributed.license-file = 27006@license.parallel.works

# Host name of the scheduler this executor connects to.
GTDistributed.client.hostname = 35.239.36.58

# Port of the scheduler this executor connects to.
GTDistributed.client.port                               = 8971

# Number of cores to use on the executor. A negative value means all available
# cores. Note that GT does not recommend running on more than the physical
# number of cores. If hyperthreading is enabled, this value should be set to the
# number of physical cores. This property may be changed without restarting the
# server.
GTDistributed.executor.core-count = 1
