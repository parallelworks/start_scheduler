# For example "+192.168.100.0/24;-192.168.100.128;-badhost.example.com" will
# accept connections only from IPs in the range 192.168.100.0 to

# rejected. This allows whitelisting of an entire subnet, and then disabling
# specific hosts via ip or name.
#
# While rules may be created using host names, we recommend using ip address
# / subnet rules wherever feasible for the following reason: if a connection filter
